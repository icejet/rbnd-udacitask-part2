# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I chose to use terminal-table and artii.  I chose terminal-table because having
the items in a table makes it more readable in my opinion.  I chose artii for
contrast and visual interest.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Undo last delete. This feature lets you undo the most recent delete.
  We all make mistakes. With this feature there is no need to recreate items
  deleted by accident.

  b) Note item type.  This feature allows for the saving of simple notes. The
  notes keep track of the note text and the date it was created.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent around 6 hours working on this.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge was figuring out ways to reduce repetition. I am
starting to get a feel for how use the techniques outline in the class
so far.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
My first feature was undo last delete. The reason I built this is because I can
imagine myself hitting the wrong number and the keyboard and deleting the wrong
item on a regular basis. With this I don't have to recreate the item I deleted.

My second feature was a note item type. I built this because I frequently take
notes about things while looking at my todo list/calendar. If I was to use this
regularly I'd need a way to keep track of simple notes without faking priorities
or due dates.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I think I could do well with taking more time to sit plan things better. I had
several false starts that probably could have been prevented with a little bit
of forethought.
